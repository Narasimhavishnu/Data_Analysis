Data ->processing ->information
introduction to data type ->categorical data,Numerical Data
Categorical ->Categorical data which can be called also as attributes. numerical data is classified into one of several categories such as hair colour locality or other attributes of population attributes form is also called as  categorical data
				types of categorical -> nominal,ordinal
				nominal ->One of the example of  nominal data is gender classification

				/*


				#nominal Level data
				ans1-input("Would you like to go for shopping? if yes then type Y / y else N/n: ")
				ans2-input("Do you love talking on any topic? if yes then type Y/ y else N/n: ")
				if(((ans1='Y')|(ans1=='y'))&((ans2='Y')|(ans2='y'))):
					print("Welcome to girls club")
				else: 
					print("Sorry boys, you can not join the club")

				Would you like to go for shopping?
				if yes then type Y y
				else N/n: N 
				Do you love talking on any topic? 
				if yes then type Y / y 
				else N/n: Y
				Sorry boys, you can not join the club

				*/
				ordinal data -> Data with an ordered series such as 

				Customer ID Rating scale
				101         Strong agree
				302          disagree
				013           neutral
				001         Strong disagree
				100             agree

				/*

				#Ordinal Level data

				marks=int(input("Enter your percentage: ")) 
				if(marks<-40):
					print("Fail")
				elif((marks>40)&(marks<-50)):
					print("Second Class")
				elif((marks>50)&(marks<-60)):
					print("First Class")
				elif (marks>-60):
					print("Congratulations!! You got distinction")

				Enter your percentage: 65
				output -
				Congratulations!! You got distinction

				Grades are given to students according to their score in the exam

Numerical Data ->Data measured on a numerical scale (distance traveled to college, the number of children in a family, etc.)
types in numerical data -> 

Discrete->  Children in a Family, number of eggs in a basket etc.Data for which only a finite number of distinct values are possible

For Example - The size of the shoe of a person can take values such as 7.5, 6, dr 9 but there is only a finite number of possible values as shown below:

Name of Participant in a Shoe Survey    Shoe Size (US)

Carol Tony                                 7

Steve																			 6

Nick                                       10

Natasha																			5

Continuous ->Sales of different departments in a quarter.Data which can be measured on a continuous scale and can have almost any numeric value in real numbers

In contrast to discrete, continuous data can take an infinite number of possible values such as a person's weight

or the price of a product as shown below:

Patient ID    Weight of Patient (Kg)

12 								86.5
13								76
10								15
