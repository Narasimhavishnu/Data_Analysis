What is Statistical Analysis?

Practice or science of collecting and analyzing data in large quantities
Statistics are the results of data analysis-its interpretation and presentation
Statistics are obtained from raw data and provide information

###
Benefits of Statistical Analysis in Data Science

Statistical knowledge helps you to:

← →
use  the proper methods to collect the data and employ the correct analyses

Conduct research and present the result effectively

Find structure in data and make relevant predictions

Apply various statistical methods to Bald Machine Learning models


###
Statistical Analysis Divisions

Statistics provides an insight into data through two categories as shown below :-

Descriptive Statistics :- Uses the data to provide descriptions of the population

Descriptive Statistical Analysis Example :- Let's say you want statistical insight on exam marks of 100 student

Descriptive Statistics will help you describe the data and emerging patterns on these (100 students which in this case is called population

This type of statistics will not allow you to make conclusions beyond the data you have analyzed (100Population

Descriptive Statistics is the branch of Statistics that involves organizing, displaying, and describing data

Example of Descriptive Statistic
It deals with the presentation of numencal fact or data is other tabular or graphical form For Example A student's grade point average

(GPA) provides a good understanding and  analyzing his overall performance

measures used in descriptive statistics :- 
Measures of Central Tendency ;- The data values for most numerical variables tend to group around a specific value Measures of Central Tendency 
describe to what extent this pattern holds for a specific variable


The three commonly used measures are shown below : MEAN :- Represents the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of the values
The mean of a set of numbers X,, X2 X3.....X, is

defined as,
overline x = SUM(Xi)/n

import pandas as pd import numpy as np
x=[2,4,6,7,20,10,22
y=np. array(x)
print ("Mean is ',y.mean ())


MEDIAN : - Represents the middle value in a dataset that is arranged in ascending order

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
ap=[12,4,4,7,20,10,221]
print ("Median is,ap.median (y))

MODE :- Defines the most frequently occurring value in a dataset

from statistics import mode
print("Mode is:", mode([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 41,31])
 mode is 3
 In some cases, a dataset may contain multiple modes while some datasets may not have any mode at all

Measures of Dispersion

Measures of Position

Inferential Statistics :- Makes inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample
Inferential Statistical Analysis Example :- Let's say you want statistical insight on exam marks of all students in the whole of the US

Inferential Statistics analyzes a sample of the population and makes inferences about the predictions for the population


###

What is Population?

A collection or set of individuals or objects or events whose properties are to be analyzed

POPULATION MEAN = μ

###
What is a Sample?

A subset of a population is called "Sample. A well-chosen sample will contain most of the information about a population parameter

population -> random part -> sample

sample mean - X -line over he x
