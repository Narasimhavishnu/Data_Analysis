Inferential Statistics

Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution
 Inferential Statistics is one of the two main branches of Statistics
Population
Sample
Inferennal statistics use a random sample of  data taken from a population to describe and make inferences about the population inferential statistics are 
valuable when Examination of each member of an entire population is not convenient or possible

Parameter Space -The set of all admissible values of the parameter is called parameter space

Sample Space-The set of all samples of same size that can be drawn from a population is called sample space

Sampling Distributions - The distribution of the values of a statistic for different samples of same size is called its sampling distribution

standard error (SE) - The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic is called its Standard Error
Standard Error of Means

â€¢ Single Sample Mean:
Let a random sample of size n be drawn from a population with mean and standard deviation o Then, the sampling distribution
of the simple mean & has the following mean and SE:


Difference of Sample Means:
Let a random sample of size 7, be drawn from a population with mean, and standard deviation Similarly, a random sample of size n be drawn from a population with mean 
and standard deviation o Then, the mean and SE of the difference of sample means, 

Standard Error of Proportions
Single Sample Proportion:
Let a random sample of size n be drawn from a population with a population proportion P Then, the sample proportion p has the following mean and SE

Difference of Sample Proportions:
Let a random sample of size 1, be drawn from a population with proportion P Similarly, a random sample of size n be drawn from a population with proportion P Then,
the mean and SE of the difference of sample means p, and pare
